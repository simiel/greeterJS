A simple JavaScript Demonstration

Anytime I hear greeter, I remember the greeter joke from the stand-up comedy special
Kevin Hart hosted in his home during covid. His highly animated performance of that
joke made me appreciate the passion he has for what he does.
Guess what, when I finally learn animation, I'll try it out on this project.
